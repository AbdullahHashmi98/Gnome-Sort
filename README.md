# Gnome-Sort
Gnome Sort is proposed by Iranian Computer Scientist Hamid Sarbazi Azad.Gnome sort is an algorithm which helps you to sort your data as your requirenment.Gnome sort is very efficient for small data to sort.

# Similarity
Gnome is similar to insertion sort as it works with one element at a time to place it in its proper position and use series of swapping as bubble sort.Np nested loops.

# Time Complexity
Its best case is O(n) and worst case has O(n^2).

# How it works
In Gnome sort compare its current position element with previous one.If an element in its current position is less than with the previous one than it swaps with the adjacent element and move one position backward otherwise it move one position forward.

# Use cases
It can be use to sort folders in windows desktop environment.
